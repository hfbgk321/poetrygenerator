# The function will generate num random related words using
# the CFD based on the bigrams in our corpus, starting from
# source. So, the first word will be generated from the CFD
# using source as the key, the second word will be generated
# using the first word as the key, and so on.
# If the CFD list of a word is empty, then a random word is
# chosen from the entire corpus.
# The function returns a num-length list of words.
